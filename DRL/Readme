DRL-Based Disease Prediction
Overview

This project applies Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for disease classification using patient sensor data.
The system uses supervised warm-start pretraining followed by REINFORCE policy gradient fine-tuning.

Pipeline

Preprocessing

Features: Age, Gender, Heart Rate, Temperature, Blood Pressure, SpO2

Standard scaling and label encoding

SMOTE oversampling for imbalance

Supervised Warm-Start

Train neural network with focal loss

Provides initial weights for DRL

DRL Fine-Tuning (REINFORCE)

Agent predicts disease

Rewards:

Correct prediction: +10

Correct rare disease: +15

Wrong prediction: -2

Policy updated with REINFORCE and baseline
